# DeepLearning-Watermarking
Major study : Watermarking test with Deep-Learning process. tThe project leverages the power of deep learning algorithms to embed and extract watermarks from images and videos, ensuring that the watermarks are imperceptible to the human eye while remaining resilient to various attacks.
